# Action for Installing MATLAB on GitHub-Hosted Runner

Use the [Set Up MATLAB](#set-up-matlab) GitHub&reg; action when you want to run MATLAB&reg; code and Simulink&reg; models on a [GitHub-hosted](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners) runner. The action installs the specified MATLAB release on a Linux virtual machine. If you do not specify a release, the action installs the latest release of MATLAB. 

The **Set Up MATLAB** action is not supported on [self-hosted](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) runners. Currently, it is available only for public projects and does not include transformation products, such as MATLAB Coder&trade; and MATLAB Compiler&trade;.

## Usage Examples
Once you install MATLAB on a GitHub-hosted runner, you can use the runner to execute MATLAB scripts, functions, or statements. You also can use the runner to execute MATLAB and Simulink tests and generate test artifacts. To execute code on the runner, include the [Run MATLAB Command](https://github.com/matlab-actions/run-command/) or [Run MATLAB Tests](https://github.com/matlab-actions/run-tests/) actions in your workflow.

### Run MATLAB Script on GitHub-Hosted Runner
Set up a GitHub-hosted runner to run the commands in a file named `myscript.m` in the root of your repository. To run the script, include the [Run MATLAB Command](https://github.com/matlab-actions/run-command/) action in your workflow.

```yaml
name: Run MATLAB Script on GitHub-Hosted Runner
on: [push]
jobs:
  my-job:
    name: Run MATLAB Script
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install MATLAB
        uses: matlab-actions/setup-matlab@v0
      - name: Run script
        uses: matlab-actions/run-command@v0
        with:
          command: myscript
```

### Run MATLAB Tests on GitHub-Hosted Runner
Set up a GitHub-hosted runner to automatically run the tests in your [MATLAB project](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/projects.html) and generate a JUnit test results report and a Cobertura code coverage report. To run the tests and generate the artifacts, include the [Run MATLAB Tests](https://github.com/matlab-actions/run-tests/) action in your workflow.

```yaml
name: Run MATLAB Tests on GitHub-Hosted Runner
on: [push]
jobs:
  my-job:
    name: Run MATLAB Tests and Generate Artifacts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install MATLAB
        uses: matlab-actions/setup-matlab@v0
      - name: Run tests and generate artifacts
        uses: matlab-actions/run-tests@v0
        with:
          test-results-junit: test-results/results.xml
          code-coverage-cobertura: code-coverage/coverage.xml
```

## Set Up MATLAB
When you define your workflow in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository, you can specify the **Set Up MATLAB** action as `matlab-actions/setup-matlab@v0`. The action accepts an optional input.

| Input     | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `release` | (Optional) MATLAB release to install. You can specify R2020a or a later release. If you do not specify release, the action installs the latest release of MATLAB.<br/>**Example**: `R2020a`

## Notes
By running the **Set Up MATLAB** action, you will be executing third-party code that is licensed under separate terms.
